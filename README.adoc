= Blog UI

It's based on https://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap].
Actually it just uses Bootstrap CSS utilities. There is not
much animated elements on the pages. Except for auto collapsed header.

Responsive page width, image width and other styles are
carefully designed according to many documentation style guides. e.g. https://developers.google.com/style[Google developer style guide].

The UI is particularly made for technical writers. It is
fine for any kind of writing in terms of comprehensive formatting.
